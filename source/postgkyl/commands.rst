Function/Command reference
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is the reference for Postgkyl functions and commands. In the most
cases, the commands are simple `click <http://click.pocoo.org>`_
wrappers of the Python function. However, where a command addresses
something that is easilly done in a script, there is no Python
function equivalent.

Examples are provided simultaneously for the analogous functions and
commands using output files of an electrostatic two-stream instability
simulation [:doc:`two-stream.lua<input/two-stream>`].
