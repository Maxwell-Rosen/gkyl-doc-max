# About

This is the documentation and tutorials for the
[gkyl](https://github.com/ammarhakim/gkyl) project


In order to build the docs (and look at them prior to pushing, for example):

1. Install ``sphinx``, e.g. ``conda install sphinx``.
2. Install the immaterial theme: ``pip install sphinx-immaterial``.
3. In the ``gkyl-doc`` directory do ``make html``.
4. Open the desired .html file in the ``build`` directory.
